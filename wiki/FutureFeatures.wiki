#summary A brainstorming list of future features we'd like to add
#labels Phase-Design

Below are a list of possible features we're considering adding to PPP for Android. Some we consider to be secondary features, so they are a lower priority, while others may be more critical and may be added before our initial release. This list is currently not sorted in any way, so no priority has been assigned to them (yet).

  * *Import/Export Mechanism:* Essentially, provide a means to import and export card set parameters to and from a file on removable storage (i.e. SD or microSD card). This will provide a means of transferring parameters from one device to another if the user needs access from multiple devices, or for backing up parameter data and storing it off-device. The import/export file should be encrypted, keyed off a password supplied by the user. Whether or not strike-out data is included might be optional (but ideal for backup purposes).
  * *Off-Device Backup:* This will likely be a corollary of the above item. The primary backup mechanism will probably be an export file which can then be moved off-device and stored securely on a desktop or laptop computer. Restoration would require moving the export file back to the device and importing it. Another option might be to look into Android's built-in backup mechanism (Android 2.2 and up only) to store the data "in the cloud", although encryption would certainly be required, as would Internet access (which is currently not required).
  * *Card Set Parameter QR Codes:* One possibility of getting card set parameters from the target site to the device might be to have the site generate a specially formatted QR code in addition to generating printable cards. If the user then has a barcode scanning app such as [https://code.google.com/p/zxing/ ZXing]'s [https://market.android.com/details?id=com.google.zxing.client.android&feature=search_result Barcode Scanner], we could pass it an intent, have the user scan the code with that intent, and have the scanner return the scanned text. Strike-out data would not be included, and perhaps the last/current card and display name may be optional.
