/* ClipboardManager.java
 * 
 * PROGRAMMER:    Jeffrey T. Darlington
 * DATE:          June 17, 2011
 * PROJECT:       Perfect Paper Passwords for Android
 * ANDROID V.:	  1.1
 * REQUIRES:      
 * REQUIRED BY:   
 * 
 * This class provides a basic wrapper around the ClipboardManager object
 * provided by Android.  In Android 3.0 (Honeycomb, API 11), the older
 * android.text.ClipboardManager object was deprecated in favor of the
 * new android.content.ClipboardManager object, which supports more
 * types of clipboard data than just text.  Unfortunately, this means that
 * our old code now begins to throw warnings due to the deprecated code.
 * 
 * Since we don't need must in the way of functionality for our clipboard
 * in PPP (we'll only be putting text there, not reading it back or
 * putting anything else), this class is pretty simple.  The abstract
 * wrapper provides a newInstance() method that returns the appropriate
 * ClipboardManager object for the API level we are currently running under.
 * Otherwise, it provides only one other abstract method, setText(), which
 * the subclasses must implement.  Each subclass uses the methods appropriate
 * for the API to copy the supplied text to the clipboard.
 * 
 * This is based heavily on a blog post from the official Android developer's
 * blog, found here:
 * http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2010/07/how-to-have-your-cupcake-and-eat-it-too.html
