# Screenshots #

These screenshots are taken using the Android Emulator running Android 1.6 ("Donut"). Other versions of Android will look similar, although some controls may have different appearances or "themes" based on the version of Android currently being used.

This is the card set list or "main menu", displaying the names of all card sets in the database. This is a scrolling list, so you can have as many card sets in your database as your device's memory can hold. The big "plus" button is the "add" or "new" button, allowing you to add new card sets to the database.

This is the new card set screen, which allows you to specify your card set parameters: name, rows, columns, passcode length, alphabet, and sequence key. The "Create Card Set" button is below the sequence key field, but is currently scrolled off the view port.

The card set details list is accessible from the main card set list by doing a "tap and hold" on the card set name in the list, then choosing "Details". This is a read-only view of the card set parameters, including a count of all "strike outs" in the database.

This is the main "card view", complete with several passcodes already "struck out". Strike out data is stored in the database so a history of your passcode use can be displayed as you scroll through the cards. Cards can be navigated by the "previous" and "next" buttons at the top of the screen, or by swiping your finger across the card. You can navigate to any arbitrary card by tapping the Menu button followed by "Go To" in the pop-up menu.

This is the "single passcode" view available on "small" device screens. "Small" Android devices cannot practically display the complete card view; to fit the entire card on the screen, the passcode font must be so small that the text is unreadable and the passcodes are almost impossible to "strike out". This view allows small devices to still use PPP for Android by displaying a single passcode at a time, specified by the card, row, and column numbers. "Strike out" data is still stored in the database so the passcode history is still maintained.

Finally, proof that PPP for Android runs on tablets, too! This is the card view again, this time running under Android 3.0 on another instance of the emulator. PPP is fully forward-compatible, although it does not make the most efficient use of space on larger screen devices yet.
