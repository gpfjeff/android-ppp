Google Code has disabled the ability to host downloadable files for projects hosted here. Below you will find links for downloading versions of PPP for Android after this new policy took effect. As always, we strongly recommend that you use the latest version of PPP for Android whenever possible. Since PPP for Android may be considered a security application, we do not recommend the use of older deprecated releases unless you encounter a problem with the latest release that you cannot work around. Of course, if you encounter such a problem, we strongly suggest you report the issue in our [Issue tracker](http://code.google.com/p/android-ppp/issues/list) so we can fix it.

Older versions of PPP for Android can be found at the [Downloads](http://code.google.com/p/android-ppp/downloads/list) link in the project menu bar above. Note that since these old versions are considered deprecated, the list will appear empty when you first load that page. Select "All downloads" from the Search drop-down list and click the Search button to see the entire list.

The following links point to the latest version of the PPP for Android download files hosted on Google Drive. The SHA-1 hash for each file can also be found below.
