When Google Code disabled the ability to host downloadable files for projects, we created this wiki page to host download links. At this point, I'm still not familiar enough with GitHub to know what (if anything) we can do about hosting pre-built binaries. For now, we plan to keep this page in place and adjust things later if necessary.

Below you will find links for downloading versions of PPP for Android. As always, we strongly recommend that you use the latest version of PPP for Android whenever possible. Since PPP for Android may be considered a security application, we do not recommend the use of older deprecated releases unless you encounter a problem with the latest release that you cannot work around. Of course, if you encounter such a problem, we strongly suggest you report the issue in our [Issue tracker](https://github.com/gpfjeff/android-ppp/issues) so we can fix it.

Older versions of PPP for Android are, unfortuntately, no longer available. We will try to make these binaries available as versions are deprecated in the future.

As always, the latest version is also available via [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gpfcomics.android.ppp), which supports automatic updates.

The following links point to the latest version of the PPP for Android download files hosted on Google Drive. The SHA-1 hash for each file can also be found below.
